## Usage

- These scripts are intended for use in development, testing, or controlled diagnostic environments.
- Many scripts intentionally trigger errors, long waits, or resource usage spikesâ€”**do not use in production**.
- To use, deploy the `.aspx` files to an IIS or compatible ASP.NET environment and access them via browser or HTTP client.

## Disclaimer

Use these utilities at your own risk. They are for educational and diagnostic purposes only. Some scripts may require elevated permissions or specific IIS/app pool settings.
